* Decrypting simple substitution ciphers using Markov Chain Monte Carlo

For details on how this works, read the PDF file, "MonteCarloProject.pdf".

A simple substitution cipher simply replaces one letter of the alphabet with
another. Say we have the following mapping:

| Alphabet | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z |
| Mapping  | K | N | Q | B | G | C | R | H | Y | J | E | V | U | T | D | F | P | O | X | I | L | W | Z | M | S | A |

Using the above mapping, We can encrpy any string of text simply by replacing
the letters in the string with the corresponding letter in the mapping. For
example: "MONTE CARLO METHODS" -> "UDTIG QKOVD UGIHDBX"

In this project my partner and I encrypt then decrypt one of my favourite books,
"Flatland" by Edwin A Abbott, using this substitution cipher and MCMC.

* How it works
The idea is quite simple. In the english language pairs of letters appear more
frequently than others. For example, "QU" is a very common pair, as "Q" is
almost always followed by a "U". Other common pairs include "ED" or "TS". The
following shows the probabilities of pairs of letters appearing one after the
other, using "War and Peace" by Leo Tolstoy.

We used "War and Peace" to train our model to 'learn' the most frequently
occuring pairs, and based on these frequencies we swap letters in a random
mapping around until our MCMC algorithm converges.

Below is an example of a single run of our MCMC algorithm:
